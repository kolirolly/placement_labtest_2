Technical Debt Analysis Report
Date: January 15, 2024
Lead Engineer: Mike Chen

CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEBT:

1. Legacy Authentication System
Priority: CRITICAL
Effort: 3-4 weeks
Impact: Security vulnerability, blocking new integrations
Description: Current auth system built 3 years ago, uses deprecated libraries with known vulnerabilities. Preventing SSO implementation and compliance certifications.

2. Database Query Performance
Priority: HIGH
Effort: 2 weeks
Impact: Customer-facing performance issues
Description: Several N+1 query problems in user dashboard and reports. Search queries taking 8-12 seconds with large datasets.

3. Frontend Bundle Size
Priority: MEDIUM
Effort: 1 week
Impact: Slow page loads, poor mobile experience
Description: Bundle size increased 300% in last 6 months. Multiple duplicate dependencies, unused code not being tree-shaken.

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:

Code Quality Issues:
- 847 ESLint warnings across codebase
- Test coverage at 34% (target: 80%)
- 23 TODO comments older than 6 months
- No automated code review process

Infrastructure Debt:
- Running on Node.js 14 (EOL approaching)
- Outdated Docker images with security vulnerabilities
- Manual deployment process prone to errors
- No backup strategy for user-uploaded files

Architecture Concerns:
- Monolithic backend becoming unwieldy (45k LOC)
- No proper error logging/monitoring
- API rate limiting implemented inconsistently
- Email service coupled tightly to main application

RECOMMENDED PRIORITIZATION:

Q1 Focus:
1. Upgrade authentication system (blocks compliance)
2. Fix critical database performance issues
3. Implement proper error monitoring

Q2 Focus:
1. Frontend performance optimization
2. Increase test coverage to 60%
3. Node.js and dependency updates

ESTIMATED TECHNICAL DEBT COST:
- Development velocity impact: 25-30% slower feature delivery
- Maintenance cost: $15,000/month in extra engineering time
- Security risk: High (potential data breach)
