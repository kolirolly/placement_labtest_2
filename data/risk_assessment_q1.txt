Project Risk Assessment - Q1 2024
Assessment Date: January 8, 2024
Risk Owner: Sarah Johnson (Project Manager)

HIGH RISK ITEMS:

1. Key Personnel Dependency
Risk Level: HIGH
Probability: 60%
Impact: Critical
Description: Mike (lead backend developer) is single point of failure for payment system and authentication. No backup developer familiar with these systems.
Mitigation: Cross-training David on backend systems, documenting critical processes
Timeline: 2 weeks

2. Third-Party API Reliability
Risk Level: HIGH
Probability: 40%
Impact: High
Description: Heavy dependency on Stripe API for payments and SendGrid for emails. Service outages directly impact customers.
Mitigation: Implement fallback payment processor, queue email system with retries
Timeline: 4 weeks

3. Security Vulnerability Exposure
Risk Level: HIGH
Probability: 70%
Impact: Critical
Description: Legacy authentication system has known vulnerabilities. Potential for data breach.
Mitigation: Accelerate auth system modernization, implement additional monitoring
Timeline: 6 weeks

MEDIUM RISK ITEMS:

4. Database Performance Degradation
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Probability: 80%
Impact: Medium
Description: Query performance declining as data grows. May hit breaking point in 3-4 months.
Mitigation: Database optimization sprint, consider sharding strategy
Timeline: Ongoing

5. Customer Churn Due to Issues
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Probability: 50%
Impact: High
Description: Recent performance issues and bugs causing customer dissatisfaction (NPS dropped to 42).
Mitigation: Prioritize customer-facing bug fixes, improve communication
Timeline: 2 weeks

6. Budget Overrun on Infrastructure
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Probability: 30%
Impact: Medium
Description: Cloud costs growing 15% faster than projected due to inefficient API usage.
Mitigation: API usage optimization, cost monitoring alerts
Timeline: 3 weeks

LOW RISK ITEMS:

7. Compliance Certification Delays
Risk Level: LOW
Probability: 25%
Impact: Medium
Description: SOC 2 certification may be delayed if auth system not upgraded in time.
Mitigation: Fast-track auth system work, engage auditors early
Timeline: 8 weeks

RISK MONITORING SCHEDULE:
- Weekly review of high-risk items
- Monthly full risk assessment update
- Quarterly risk register review with stakeholders

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
- Any high-risk item probability increases above 75%
- New critical risks identified
- Mitigation timelines missed by more than 1 week
